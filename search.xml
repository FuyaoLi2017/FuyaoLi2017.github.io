    <url>%2F2019%2F05%2F11%2Fleetcode-975%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[You are given an integer array A. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, …) jumps in the series are called odd numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, …) jumps in the series are called even numbered jumps. You may from index i jump forward to index j (with i &lt; j) in the following way: During odd numbered jumps (ie. jumps 1, 3, 5, …), you jump to the index j such that A[i] &lt;= A[j] and A[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indexes j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j. During even numbered jumps (ie. jumps 2, 4, 6, …), you jump to the index j such that A[i] &gt;= A[j] and A[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indexes j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.(It may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.) A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index A.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once.) Return the number of good starting indexes. ###Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-jump/ 1.

    <title><![CDATA[GraphQL-4 Building A GraphQL API]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F05%2F01%2Fgraphql-4%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[In this chapter, we discuss the features of a GraphQL API and mechanics behind it. 4.1 GraphQL API mechanicsAll GraphQL APIs offer a number features that we need to understand in order build GraphQL APIs. The heart of this configuration is the GraphQL schema with its type definition. GraphQL Validation: Any request that is received by a GraphQL API, is first syntactically validated against the GraphQL SCHEMA. GraphQL Execution: After the request has been validated, it needs to be interpreted and execute by the server to create a response. Execution of queries: The graphQL SERVER returns a result that structurally mirrors the shape of the requested query. Before sending to the client, the server serializes the result, typically in JSON format. Creating a response to a query is actually a traversal of the graph. Resolver functions: the resolver function is called recursively. For each of the subgraphs produced as output. A subgraph is an instance of a certain type. When such a subgraph is processed, the resolver function of its corresponding type is called. If the resolver function for a certain subgraph produces a scalar value like a string or number, the recursion terminates in that branch. The resolver function receive three arguments. obj: the parent object of the fields being resolved(graphQL query/mutation/subscription).(often null or left out). args: the arguements provided to the fields in the graphQL query/mutation/subscription. context: holds important contextual information, such as authenticated user and access to a database. Execution of subscription: There is no confirmation response. A response is only generated when the event actually occurs. The best practice to realize this bidirectional communication via teh webSocket protocol. 4.2 GraphQL server architecture4.2.1 Green Field case: without involving any existing legacy systemsThere can be multiple API endpoints lying above business logic.RPC APIs, REST APIs, GraphQL APIs =&gt; Business logic =&gt; DB 4.2.2 Legacy caseCases we need to deal with existing legacy services and databases. 4.3 GraphQL API design methodology]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[GraphQL-3 GraphQL query language]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F04%2F19%2Fgraphql-3%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[3.1 PatternsGraphQL queries consist of one or more patterns which are matched agianst the big graph containing all the data on the server. A pattern is expressed in terms of the relationships between objects and the fields the objects contain. Multi-level hierarchies can be built because a field can also be an object which contains its own fields. 3.2 GraphQL methods query is used for retrieval, for reading data(see 3.3) mutation is used for modification, for writing data (see 3.4) subscription is used for notification of changed data (see 3.5) 3.3 GraphQL QueryTo read data with graphQL, the client uses the query method. In the pattern of this query, the client has to explicitly specify all the object and fields it is interested in. 12345query &#123; books &#123; title &#125;&#125; Executing the query might result in the following data, which is returned in JSON format. For graphQL, query and response have the same shape. The query is comparable to a template in a template language. Just like functions in JS, queries can be anonymous or named. If a query is given a name, it allows us identify it easier later on.12345query myBookQuery &#123; books &#123; title &#125;&#125; 3.3.1 Objects Inside the query method, one or more objects can be retrieved. An object can not be retrieved without explicitly specifying the fields that should be returned. 3.3.2 Fields Objects have fields of their own, primitives do not. The types of the fields are objects, array or a primitive type. The query language does not ditinguish between lists and single elements, such as primitives or objects. If the fields is a list, its fields are actually the fields of each element in the list. 12345query &#123; books &#123; title &#125;&#125; If field has further fields itself, we can create a new level of nesting. The result tree gets deeper. 12345678query &#123; books &#123; title author [ name ] &#125;&#125; 3.3.3 Arguments An argument is used to put constraints on objects. Only objects which satisfy the constraints imposed by the argument are included in the result. An argument in GraphQL is comparable to a WHERE in SQL. In graphQL, the arguments are identified and passed in by their name.(id in our example) 3.3.4 Alias To avoid name confilct, we cna rename a fields with an alias.12345678query &#123; book_by_id (id:&quot;1234&quot;) &#123; title &#125; second_book: book_by_id (id:&quot;5678&quot;) &#123; title &#125;&#125; 3.3.5 Fragments Some queries contain repeating elements. In this case, it is tedious to get consistent in the first palce and tedious to maintain consistency. Repeating elements of a query can be factored out into socalled fragments. Fragments need to be defined once (using fragment keyword) and can be applied mulitple times (using the … keyword) ExampleWe can rewrite the previous example with the following code sample. 123456789101112131415query &#123; book_by_id (id:&quot;1234&quot;) &#123; ...bookinfo &#125; second_book: book_by_id (id:&quot;5678&quot;) &#123; ...bookinfo &#125;&#125;fragment bookinfo on Book &#123; title author &#123; name &#125;&#125; Note, that a fragment is defined for a specific type. (see section 2.3),in our example, the fragment is specific for a Book. 3.3.6 Inline Fragments Inline fragment are used to distinguish different types. It is similar to an instanceof operator in OOP languages. Inline fragments are for ploymorphism, i.e. for interface and union types. With inline fragments, we can check the type of an object at runtime. Example of using inline fragment in interface To access the private-owned fields of implementation type of interfaces. We need to use inline fragments. We first define an interface and two implementation types. 1234567891011121314151617interface Document &#123; title: String, text: String, authors: [Author]&#125;type Book implements Document &#123; id: ID!&#125;type Article implements Document &#123; magazine: String!&#125;type Query &#123; readingList: [Document]&#125; If we want to access the id field for Book or magazine field for article, we need to specify which type it really belongs to, we need to use inline fragment in this case. The query format should be as follows. 123456789101112131415query &#123; readingList &#123; title text authors&#123; name &#125; ... on Book &#123; id &#125; ... on Article &#123; magazine &#125; &#125;&#125; For interfaces, we use use inline fragments to access additional fields. For union types, since a union in general share no fields. Inline fragment have to be used for accessing any fields in a union. 3.3.7 Variables Variables can be used to pass different values into a query. When this value needs to be changed, the query itself can stay as it is. Format {$variable name}: {type of the bookID}[!,nothing(means whether this is a required parameter)] [= default value] 12345query getSpecificBook ($BookID: String = &quot;1234&quot;) &#123; book_by_id (id: $bookID) &#123; title &#125;&#125; Variable need to have a type (primitive or object type) 3.3.8 Directives Directives can be used to dynamically include or exclude a part of a query. Dynamically means depending on the value of boolean variable. This boolean variable has to be decleared just like any other variables. There are two types of directives: one to include (@include keyword) a part of the query and one to exclude (@skip keywords) a part of the query.123456query getBooks($flag: boolean) &#123; books&#123; title id @include(if: $flag) &#125;&#125; The above examples includes the id fields only if the value $flag is true. 123456query getBooks($flag: boolean) &#123; books&#123; title id @skip(if: $flag) &#125;&#125; The above example is the reverse meaning for the first example. 3.4 GraphQL mutations The mutation method is used for modifying, adding or writing data on the server with GraphQL.123456mutation &#123; addBook (title: &quot;New Book&quot;) &#123; id title &#125;&#125; 3.5 GraphQL Subscirption Modern clients need to get near real-time updates that get triggered when something changes on the server. REST does not provide any built-in support for such notifications from the server; thus notifications are often realized by polling or by webhooks. You can refer more details about webhooks in the below resources. Book, Webhooks - Events for REST APIs https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/ With polling, the client periodically sends requests to the server. The client usually needs to poll on an endpoint that returns a list of elements and compares the retrieved list against the previously retrieved list in order to find the new elements.(expensive operation) With webhooks, the server calls the client, whenever the resources becomes available. To set this up, the client first needs to register an endpoint that gets called by the server. The client needs to be able to expose this endpoint that can receive the events. GraphQL implementation GraphQL offers subscriptions as a built-in mechanism for realizing notifications. First step: client need to send a subscription request to the graphQL API. The request specfies both the event to observe and the data. 123456subscription &#123; bookAdded &#123; id title &#125;&#125; When to trigger? In most cases, notification is triggered by a modification of the data inside the graph, i.e. mutation. This means an event handler needs to be installed inside the implementation of the mutation. In rare cases, notifcation can be triggered by an external event, which is direclty accessible inside the graph or only accessible in aggregated form. An example is sensor data, of which a single measurement may be used as a trigger, whereas the graph only contains aggredated sensor data and no single measurements. I still have some questions regarding how to implement the Subscriptions with GraphQL! Remaining to be explored!]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F04%2F14%2Fgraphql-2%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[GraphQL Type SystemGraphQL have strong type systems. A field can be amrked with an exclamation mark ! to indicate that the field is obligatory (will not be null). Otherwise, it will be nillable (optional fields). During execution/resolutoin of a query, the type system helps to determine what to do next. When crafting queries, the introspection mechanism provided through the type system, allows us to do syntax directly editing and guide us with respect to what is possible and available. Root typesRoot types can be used as the starting point for a certain operation. Query Mutation SubscriptionNoticeEvery graphQL implementation must ahve define a query and a mutation and subscription can be optional. 12345678910111213type Query &#123; books: [Book] book(title:String!): Book book_by_id(id:ID!):Book&#125;type Mutation &#123; addBook(title: String!): Book&#125;type Subscription &#123; bookAdded: Book&#125; Scalar Typesbuilt-in GraphQL scalar types int float boolean String ID (used uniquely identify an object) Custom scalar types Isbn (example) [Author] (square brackets represent a list of things) Array representation Used to express a list of objects [int] [Book] EnumAn enum has a limited set of values it can possibly to take on.12345enum trafficLight &#123; RED GREEN YELLOW&#125; Interface An interface is similar to a type definition, it defines a list of fields, but it can’t be instantiated. 12345interface Document &#123; title: String text: String authors: [Author]&#125; A regular type that implements the interface can extend the interface. 123type Book implements Document &#123; id: ID!&#125; The implementing type automatically contains the fields defined in the interface, they don’t need to be mentioned explicitly. To access the additional fields of a type implementing an interface in a query, we always need to make a distinction by type using inline fragments.(refer to section3.3.6) Union A Union is a common type for serveral defining types. If an object is of a union type, it could be any of it s defining types.1union Product = Book | Software | Bread Differences between Union and interfaces interface is to express common fields union don’t need to have fields in common To access the fields of a union type, we need to make a distinction by type using in the inline fragments.(section3.3.6) Input TypesInput types are used for passing input data in the form of arguments. Input types are used in mutations. When an instance of an input type is serialized, the data is formatted in JSON syntax. It looks like the definition of regular object types, but with keyword input instead of type. !!!! Input types can’t have fields of an object type, only scalar types, list types, and other input types. To prevent mixing, it is a useful convention, to amrk input types, e.g. by using the postfix Input.123456789input BookInput &#123; title: String authors: [AuthorInput]&#125;input AuthorInput &#123; name: String books: [BookInput]&#125;]]></content>

    <url>%2F2019%2F04%2F03%2Fgraphql-1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This series of articles are summarized from “GraphQL API design” 1.1 Interaction between frontend and backendThese needs of frontends regarding the interaction with backends are quite universal. Thus, a couple of philosophies, such as RPC, SOAP, REST, and GraphQL, have been developed to structure the interaction between frontend and backend. What is GraphQL?GraphQL allows us to build APIs for retrieving data, writing data and getting notified when data changes. GraphQL offers: a declarative, typed query language for APIs a schema language for specifying data structures a runtime for building APIs Why are there two languages in GraphQL?1. Query languageThe purpose of the query language is to interact with the GraphQL endpoint. 2. schema definition languageTo define the structure of the business data exposed by the GraphQL API. API providers use the schema definition language to specify the interface. What the graph in GraphQL?A graph is a very generic data structure, it should be possible to express the data of any application in the form of a graph. And this graph, formed by all application data, is what we call the graph in GraphQL. All data is exposed via a single endpoint in GraphQL. Compared with REST endpoints, the single GraphQL endpoint expose a lot of data. This comprehensive set of data with its entities and relationships between the various entities forms the graph of GraphQL. REST APIs exposes data not in a format of generic type. Both REST and GraphQL are capable of expressing application data in form of a graph, with GraphQL the graph is more explicit, since it is served on a single endpoint. A GraphQL application GraphQL API: part of the backend GraphQL client: part of the frontend]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Intuition of writing this BlogAs an intern in ardent academy, I must know how to deploy projects in a secure and reliable manner. We work on Agile development environment. There are something I need to pay attention to when I want to submit a PR to the working repo. Starting a task Go to the “Active Sprints” section of your project and find an Issue. Change the status from “To Do” to “IN PROGRESS” and start your development. Completing a task Once tbe development is done and create a pull request (PR) and commit your code, follow the conventional commits and git flow. We rely on a Continuous Integration and Delivery system (CI/CD) called Drone. Drone runs unit tests then deploys our applications to their staging and production environments. Visit our Drone dashboard at drone.ardentlabs.io to see the progress of your build. Unit testing Run Prettier to format your code: npm run prettier Commit the changes to a new branch. Each branch should contain one functional change, accompanied with tests and/or migration scripts. The smaller the change, the faster it takes for others to review. Feature: feat/office-location Refactor: refactor/rename-classroom Fix: fix/lesson-ordering Hotfixes (Urgent fixes to master) Fork hotfix branch from master (hotfix/everything-is-on-fire) Implement your hotfix - be sure to run Prettier and follow Conventional Commits Push your branch to GitHub Create two PRs, one merging into master and one merging into develop Request reviews from reviewers then make any requested changes The two PRs should be reviewed in tandem. Once they pass reviews, merge both PRs.

    <url>%2F2019%2F03%2F25%2Fbuild-blog-with-hexo%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. My blogGenerally, I build this blog with hexo and github pages. Then, I bought a domain name and attached the github page to that domain name. This is the blog I am using right now. You can refer to the source code at this link: https://github.com/FuyaoLi2017/FuyaoLi2017.github.io, you are welcomed to fork and leave me comments~ 2. Github page and domain name settings create a github account and create a repo with exactly the name [yourusername].github.io, in the Settings tab, configure your customized domain name. Remember to create the SSH key for your local computer to upload the code to Github. I bought my domain name on Godaddy.com and configured the DNS settings following this link: https://medium.com/@coryminglee/hosting-your-github-page-in-godaddy-domain-in-2018-b872b39190f9. If you want to enable a more secure connection, you might want to buy a certificate to enable HTTPS. I think it is kind of expensive for me, so I just choose to leave it as HTTP connection. 3. Blog configuration I used Hexo to build my blog and choose the next theme to be my current theme. It allows me to update the and deploy my blog automatically. Refer to this link to generate a hexo project folder:https://hexo.io/ Most configurations are made in _config.yml(general configuration) and themes/next/_config.yml(customized configuration for your own theme) 3.1 _config.yml configuration You can follow the existing hints in the _config.yml to do basic configurations.deploymentFor the deployment, which is the most important thing, you need to configure it as follows. Remember to leave a space after type:, this is super important for all configuration, the content won’t be parsed if you don’t put a space here.1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/FuyaoLi2017/FuyaoLi2017.github.io.git branch: master Search function12345search: path: search.xml field: post format: html limit: 10000 Sitemap123# Site mapsitemap: path: sitemap.xml Theme configurations12## Themes: https://hexo.io/themes/theme: next RSSfollow this link to configure you RSS: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed.I just found that in chrome, it will just bring up the source code, which is super weird, so I disabled this function. 3.2 themes/next/_config.yml configurationfaviconThe images the relative path starts from the source folder in the themes/next, if you put a photo in the themes/next/source/images, you can configure like this.123456789101112favicon: #small: /images/favicon-16x16-next.png #medium: /images/favicon-32x32-next.png #apple_touch_icon: /images/apple-touch-icon-next.png #safari_pinned_tab: /images/logo.svg #android_manifest: /images/manifest.json #ms_browserconfig: /images/browserconfig.xml small: /images/photo.jpeg medium: /images/photo.jpeg apple_touch_icon: /images/photo.jpeg safari_pinned_tab: /images/photo.jpeg menu You can define the project folders you want to show.
