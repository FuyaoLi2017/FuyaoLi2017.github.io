    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Intuition of writing this BlogAs an intern in ardent academy, I must know how to deploy projects in a secure and reliable manner. We work on Agile development environment. There are something I need to pay attention to when I want to submit a PR to the working repo. Starting a task Go to the “Active Sprints” section of your project and find an Issue. Change the status from “To Do” to “IN PROGRESS” and start your development. Completing a task Once tbe development is done and create a pull request (PR) and commit your code, follow the conventional commits and git flow. We rely on a Continuous Integration and Delivery system (CI/CD) called Drone. Drone runs unit tests then deploys our applications to their staging and production environments. Visit our Drone dashboard at drone.ardentlabs.io to see the progress of your build. Unit testing Run Prettier to format your code: npm run prettier Commit the changes to a new branch. Each branch should contain one functional change, accompanied with tests and/or migration scripts. The smaller the change, the faster it takes for others to review. Feature: feat/office-location Refactor: refactor/rename-classroom Fix: fix/lesson-ordering Hotfixes (Urgent fixes to master) Fork hotfix branch from master (hotfix/everything-is-on-fire) Implement your hotfix - be sure to run Prettier and follow Conventional Commits Push your branch to GitHub Create two PRs, one merging into master and one merging into develop Request reviews from reviewers then make any requested changes The two PRs should be reviewed in tandem. Once they pass reviews, merge both PRs. How to do release git checkout master git pull git checkout develop git pull git merge master npm run release git push –follow-tags git checkout master git merge develop git push]]></content>

    <title><![CDATA[How to build a Blog based on Hexo]]></title>
    <url>%2F2019%2F03%2F25%2Fbuild-blog-with-hexo%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[1. My blogGenerally, I build this blog with hexo and github pages. Then, I bought a domain name and attached the github page to that domain name. This is the blog I am using right now. You can refer to the source code at this link: https://github.com/FuyaoLi2017/FuyaoLi2017.github.io, you are welcomed to fork and leave me comments~ 2. Github page and domain name settings create a github account and create a repo with exactly the name [yourusername].github.io, in the Settings tab, configure your customized domain name. Remember to create the SSH key for your local computer to upload the code to Github. I bought my domain name on Godaddy.com and configured the DNS settings following this link: https://medium.com/@coryminglee/hosting-your-github-page-in-godaddy-domain-in-2018-b872b39190f9. If you want to enable a more secure connection, you might want to buy a certificate to enable HTTPS. I think it is kind of expensive for me, so I just choose to leave it as HTTP connection. 3. Blog configuration I used Hexo to build my blog and choose the next theme to be my current theme. It allows me to update the and deploy my blog automatically. Refer to this link to generate a hexo project folder:https://hexo.io/ Most configurations are made in _config.yml(general configuration) and themes/next/_config.yml(customized configuration for your own theme) 3.1 _config.yml configuration You can follow the existing hints in the _config.yml to do basic configurations.deploymentFor the deployment, which is the most important thing, you need to configure it as follows. Remember to leave a space after type:, this is super important for all configuration, the content won’t be parsed if you don’t put a space here.1234deploy: type: git repo: https://github.com/FuyaoLi2017/FuyaoLi2017.github.io.git branch: master Search function12345search: path: search.xml field: post format: html limit: 10000 Sitemap123# Site mapsitemap: path: sitemap.xml Theme configurations12## Themes: https://hexo.io/themes/theme: next RSSfollow this link to configure you RSS: https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed.I just found that in chrome, it will just bring up the source code, which is super weird, so I disabled this function. 3.2 themes/next/_config.yml configurationfaviconThe images the relative path starts from the source folder in the themes/next, if you put a photo in the themes/next/source/images, you can configure like this.123456789101112favicon: #small: /images/favicon-16x16-next.png #medium: /images/favicon-32x32-next.png #apple_touch_icon: /images/apple-touch-icon-next.png #safari_pinned_tab: /images/logo.svg #android_manifest: /images/manifest.json #ms_browserconfig: /images/browserconfig.xml small: /images/photo.jpeg medium: /images/photo.jpeg apple_touch_icon: /images/photo.jpeg safari_pinned_tab: /images/photo.jpeg menu You can define the project folders you want to show. If you want to create more menu items. You can use hexo new page [something], refer to this link to find more detailed instructions:https://hexo.io/docs/writing.html. For the menu icons, you need to find the corresponding representation in the link https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery and configure it after the parallel just like this.1234567891011121314menu: home: / || home about Fuyao: /about/ || user tags: /tags/ || tags categories: /categories/ || th archives: /archives/ || archive Projects: /projects/ || tasks #schedule: /schedule/ || calendar sitemap: /sitemap.xml || sitemap #commonweal: /404/ || heartbeat# Enable/Disable menu icons.menu_icons: enable: true Schemesconfigure the scheme you like and uncomment it like the code script below. Examples of different schemes can be found here:https://github.com/iissnan/hexo-theme-next. Check it and find one you like better.12345# Schemes#scheme: Muse#scheme: Mistscheme: Pisces#scheme: Gemini FontsFonts can be configured in the fonts tags and it can be configured in five aspects. You can check out fonts in fonts.googleapis.com and put the name of the fonts here to update your blog’s fonts.123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627282930313233343536373839404142font: enable: true # Uri of fonts host. E.g. //fonts.googleapis.com (Default). host: # Font options: # `external: true` will load this font family from `host` above. # `family: Times New Roman`. Without any quotes. # `size: xx`. Use `px` as unit. # Global font settings used on &lt;body&gt; element. global: external: true family: Merriweather size: 14 # Font settings for Headlines (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6). # Fallback to `global` font settings. headings: external: true family: Merriweather size: 20 # Font settings for posts. # Fallback to `global` font settings. posts: external: true family: Merriweather # Font settings for Logo. # Fallback to `global` font settings. logo: external: true family: Lemon size: 26 # Font settings for &lt;code&gt; and code blocks. codes: external: true family: PT Mono size: Comment functionThere are multiple ways to realize the comment function. Disqus is a easy way to implement that, register a disqus account and configure it as follows should add comment function to your blog.12345# Disqusdisqus: enable: true shortname: [short name for your disqus account] count: true Vistor count functionThere are multiple ways to enable this function. I used leancloud to realized that. You can register an account in leancloud and create a empty database called Counter. Then, just copy the app_id and app_key here to realize that.1234leancloud_visitors: enable: true app_id: [your app id] app_key: [your app key] More advanced options background pictures can be configured in themes/next/source/css/_custom/custom.styl. My configuration works on PC side, the mobile side is not working so well, you can make more complicated cofiguration to make it adaptable. 12345678910body &#123;background-image:url(/images/golden-gate-bridge.jpg);background-repeat: no-repeat;background-size: cover;background-attachment:fixed;&#125;#footer a &#123; color:#eee;&#125; The width of the blog area is kind of too small. I configured it to be larger with relative parameter settings. After consulting so many blogs. I found the following configuration is the most simple and powerful choice. In themes/next/source/css/_variables/custom.styl, you need to configure it as follows using the calc function in CSS. 12$main-desktop = 75%$content-desktop = calc(100% - 252px) 4. EndThanks for reading my blog. Hope it can help you with buliding you own blog! You are welcome to leave comments if you have any problems.]]></content>
